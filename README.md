# E12b-Github

This was an assignment for my game technology class where we practice creating aditional reposities and using pull request in Github. We made to repositories and did a pull request for each however part of the assugnment invovled having one of the pull request fail and that didn't happen for me because I never got the "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved" when you do the secound pull request. I don't know what went wrong or if I can fix it since the pull request already went through. So I guess I'm just gonna have to accept it. You can find the instuction for the assignment in the README for the other branches
